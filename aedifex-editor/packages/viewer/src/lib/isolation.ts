 * Why layers instead of `obj.visible = false`? Three.js's visibility
 * flag *cascades* — hiding a parent hides every descendant — so we
 * can't hide a host wall while keeping a door rendered inside it.
 * Layer masks are per-object and don't cascade: `WebGLRenderer
 * .projectObject` skips objects whose layer mask doesn't intersect the
 * camera's, but always recurses into their children. So we can disable
 * `SCENE_LAYER` on the wall and the door (hosted under it in the
 * scene graph) still renders, with its local position relative to the
 * wall preserved automatically by the matrix walk.
 *
 * The original `layers.mask` is stashed under a private Symbol so
 * {@link clearIsolation} can restore the exact prior state.
 *
 * Pass `null` to clear isolation (equivalent to calling
 * {@link clearIsolation}).
