# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- **`@aedifex/core` 0.10.0** — plugin manifests now require `apiVersion: 2`; legacy
  manifest-level `panels` metadata is rejected instead of being silently ignored.
  Register editor panels through the editor host-panel registry and declare
  `pluginId`, contributed `kinds`, and `defaultInstalled` there. Node definitions
  must now declare `capabilities.deletable` explicitly. The removed
  `DEFAULT_ELEVATOR_LEVEL_HEIGHT` and `getElevatorLevelHeight` exports are replaced
  by `DEFAULT_LEVEL_HEIGHT` and `getStoredLevelHeight`.
- **`@aedifex/viewer` 0.10.0** — the legacy `WalkthroughControls` and `SlabSystem`
  exports are removed. Use the current GLB walkthrough controller for walkthrough
  playback and load slab behavior from the `@aedifex/nodes` registry definition.
- **`@aedifex/nodes` 0.2.0** — the private door implementation module is no longer
  exposed as `@aedifex/nodes/door/door-math`. Consumers should use registered door
  capabilities and editor tools instead of importing node internals.

### Fixes

- **`@aedifex/editor` 0.9.3** — require explicit delete capability semantics in
  registry-driven UI and show registered kinds through a generic scene-tree row.
- **`@aedifex/mcp` 0.3.3** — serialize SQLite writes on each store connection while
  preserving optimistic version checks and queue progress after a rejected write.
- **`@aedifex/ifc-converter` 0.1.3** — restore bounded IFC placement traversal for
  malformed `PlacementRelTo` cycles.
- **`@aedifex/plugin-trees` 0.1.1** — restore Nature panel ownership, contributed
  kinds, and default-install metadata for the v2 plugin contract.
